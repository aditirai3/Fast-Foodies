# Fast-Foodies
A group project done with @pnisenson, @skunnath2020, and @cgrove3141. The objective was to analyze the relationship between population density and location of fast food restaurant chains in the US. 

For our analysis, I mapped the location data of 5 major fast food restaurants (McDonalds, Subway, Wendy's and Burger king) against the population density of each city in the US.
Also created a bar chart of the top 10 states with highest number of locations of the fast food chains, and a bubble chart of availability of restaurants by poverty rate
All the visualizations were compiled on a dashboard (access via index.html) which is hosted on the Python HTTP server.
Tools used include the D3, Plotly, and Leaflet JavaScript libraries.

Data was sourced from Datafiniti via Kaggle, and the Census API.
